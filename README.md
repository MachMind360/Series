# Series
In this repository, we will talk about series. 

First sum of series:
We can find the sum of any series only if we can break it down to a common difference or factor.

For example: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, ..., n^2

The common difference can be found, and it is 2.

The file SumofSeries is a MATLAB code that gives the sum of a series. There is a variable called coeff it is list where you append all the first terms.
For example:  1  4  9  16  25  36  49  ...  n^2
               3   5  7  9   11  13    ...  (1+2n)
                 2   2  2  2   2       ...   2

Hence, coeff = [1 3 2]
